# Stock Price Prediction

## Introduction
Stock Price Prediction is one of the most difficult task to do, in financial sector. There are many factors involved in the prediction like physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. But we can predict a similar trend using previous data trends of a company's stock and to do so we will use a LSTM model to mimick the strategy used by quant's.
